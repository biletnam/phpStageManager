>>> BUG FIXES <<<
* Fix the weird discoloration of cancelled events in week/day view
* Fix errorcode 203 bug on checklogin.php


>>> USABILITY IMPROVEMENTS <<<
* Create intuitive, user-friendly event creation tools
* Use JS to verify matching passwords in settings.php
* Better information description on login.php


>>> APPEARANCE IMPROVEMENTS <<<
* The JS code in settings.php that restores the default colors to the jscolor thing needs to dynamically determine if the text color should be white or black
* The login box on login.php is ugly, make it normal
* Make the navbar tabs less bulky somehow
* Make viewevent.php less bulky and awkward
* Quit being lazy and rewrite new CSS for viewevent.php instead of reusing the qTip CSS
* Set up the "Only show rehearsals for" feature on mastercal.php so that only the calendar gets refreshed, not the entire page
* Clean up the sloppy use of the html h2 and h3 tags on downloads.php
* Add a qTip to events that are pulled from the U.S. holidays Google Calendar on mastercal.php
* Add printer-friendly CSS
* Need to define more default styles for basic HTML tags and not rely on the user agent stylesheet
* Make the page titles look less derpy (also, move #pagetitle inside of #pagebody)


>>> ADDED FUNCTIONALITY <<<
* Make an administrative control panel!
* Come up with a versatile permissions system?
* Make a news-events type thing for the home page instead of Google Docs, or maybe integrate wiki software
* Make a mobile site after a module system is in place using iUI or something?
* Make it more easily possible to change what navbar tabs are shown
* Make a database for scenes (i.e. so they can have titles, and maybe even grouping scenes into acts)
* Add internationalization support?
* Make it possible to edit extra_roles via viewevent.php (use jQuery UI's autocomplete thing! :D)
* Add a reset password button


>>> BETTER CODING <<
* Switch from manually escaped MySQL statements to using an abstraction layer (probably mysqli, but I could write it so it supports multiple)<
* Rename all global variables in psm_config.php to begin with $psm
* Split config.php into a new file called includes.php, and change all pages to require_once includes.php instead of config.php
* Make pages into a module system of some sort to make the creation of a mobile site easier
* Make the errormsg thingy I use on login.php and settings.php into a function so that it's more dynamic
* Come up with a dynamic solution to the "Chorus" problem (i.e. that it shouldn't be displayed on the roles list)
* Get rid of the crap that lets new people set their password for the first time via login.php (or maybe don't, but have it as a feature!)
* Make the question mark icons on viewevent.php work dynamically (instead of being a copy-pasted img tag)
* Consider making eventsfeed.php use the JSON extension of PHP rather than manually generating JSON
* Manually deal with session storing instead of just coasting by on the defaults
* Deal with timezones (done??)
* Remove the need for the scene 0 workaround!
* Get rid of or else improve the implementation of user themes
* If anyone connects to the website via a different address than $siteaddr, 301-redirect them to the correct website address




>>> COMPLETED TASKS <<<
* In settings.php, make the left sidebar use JS instead of CSS selectors for the hover colors and remove the <a>s
* Eliminate the need for a submit button on the "Only show rehearsals for" feature on mastercal.php
* Set "appearance:none;" and all the browser-specific versions for the jscolor input boxes on settings.php
* Make the #pageheader section less derpy
* Move the page titles closer to the page content box so they're more noticeable
* Add a date and time picker for viewevent.php
* Set up tab index on the login box that is in the page header (I think I did this, need to verify in Chrome)
* Easy login via IMAP authentication
