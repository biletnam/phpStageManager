# phpStageManager

A web-based theatre management utility.

# About

I made this project in high school to replace the crappy calendar solution provided by OS X Server's wiki that our theatre department was using prior to this tool's existence. This was my first project working in PHP, and it shows -- no frameworks, no MySQL abstraction layer, a bit of a mess all around. But hey, it got the job done, and really made scheduling easier. Feel free to make use of this project and explore and whatever, but uh, please don't judge my coding skills based on this -- I know it's not exactly the most elegantly written software.

# Usage

Requires a web server with PHP 5.x (with MySQL extension) and a MySQL server.

Uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) (with Smoothness theme), [FullCalendar](http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/), [JSColor](http://jscolor.com/), [Fatcow's 3500 Free "Farm-Fresh Web Icons"](http://www.fatcow.com/free-icons)
